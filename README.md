# qfl_tern
Ternary plotting but specifically aimed at those working in geology who want to plot petrograpic data. Quartz, feldspar and lithic data derived from petrographic analysis can be plotted on a QFL diagram as per Pettijohn (1977) to gain an idea of their petrographic classification. Recently added the Dickenson (1983) classification diagram.

This repo includes a [notebook](https://github.com/trqmorgan/qfl_tern/blob/master/QFL%20notebook.ipynb) to demonstrate
the use of the QFL ternary as well as the file to run the plotting.
